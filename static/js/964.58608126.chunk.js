Isn't that cool that AI is now a degree program? I'm really fascinated in the how the nature of knowledge is being probed by developing ever more intelligent automated systems. My research involves investigating how AI can be used to enable automated aquaculture management systems. I hope my work can lead to technology that supports more harmonious relationships between man, technology and nature. \n\n# Currently\n\nI am working on a lot of different things (read: too many things) at the moment. My main effort involves research at Dr. Bing Ouyang's lab at the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute, where we are developing the Hybrid Aerial Underwater Robotic System. The aim of this research is to reduce labor costs for aquaculture farms with intelligent robotics and IoT systems. We are also working on several underwater imaging and lidar projects. I also work for Deep Forest Sciences to implement bioinformatics tools into the open source machine learning library DeepChem. These tools are enabling biologists to use state of the art AI technology without needing to be AI experts. Besides all that, I continue to work for the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab building a realtime object tracking system for use on military vessels.    \n\n# Some history\n\n- Age 3: I learned to swim, which was the beginning of my \n\n- Age 6: I learned to tie my shoes after years of wearing velcro straps.  \n\n- Age 12: I picked up the guitar and got really obsessed with it.
