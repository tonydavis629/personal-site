I am studying the use of Vision Language Models in larger software systems. In other words, how to properly train VLMs to use tools and interact with computers. This is important because much of the advancement in AI has been made in language models, but is missing the connection to the visual world. At the same time I'm applying real time object detection and tracking to algorithms to navy camera data.\n\n\n# Previous Research\n\nIn my master's at Florida Atlantic University, I worked on automating aquaculture management systems, in pursuit of making aquaculture less laborious. I also did some work at Deep Forest Sciences to implement bioinformatics tools in the open source machine learning library DeepChem. These tools are for biologists to use state of the art AI technology without needing to be AI experts.\n\n\n# Some history\n\n- Age 3: I learned to swim, and I was on the swim team for like 10 years. \n- Age 6: I learned to tie my shoes after years of wearing velcro straps.  \n- Age 12: I picked up the guitar and got really obsessed with it. I played a guitar solo at my middle school band recital. I still have a passion for music, but nowadays I play the [Gotar](https://www.starrlabs.com/product/gotar-2/).\n- Age 13: I travel to Holland to represent the US in a swimming tournament. I got 6th place in the 200 m breaststroke which I thought was pretty good. I couldn't top that so I quit swimming.\n- Age 14: I started on the wrestling team in sophomore year of high school. I made it to regionals by my senior year.\n- Age 15: I started on the cross country team in junior year. I got shin splints really bad, but by the time I figured out how to run without injurying myself I really enjoyed it.\n- Age 15: I began my professional career as a Subway Sandwich Artist in Brightwood, DC. \n- Age 17: Planning for my career after high school, I walked into a Marine Corps recruiter's office. After looking at my grades, the recruiter recommends I go to college and join ROTC, so that's what I did. Thank you SSG Gonzalez! \n- Age 18: Enlisted in the Ohio National Guared, attended basic training in Fort Benning, Georgia and finished my freshman year of at Ohio State.\n- Age 21: I was elected the President of the OSU Scabbard and Blade chapter. We hosted talks and training by some really cool military specialists. \n- Age 22: I graduated with my Bacherlor's in Mechanical Engineering (after 10 semesters) and began my career as an Army infantry officer\n- Age 23: I moved to Germany where I was stationed\n- Age 25: [My 400 year old apartment in Regensburg, Germany](https://www.mittelbayerische.de/region/regensburg-stadt-nachrichten/flexarbeiten-setzten-haus-in-brand-21179-art1809502.html) burned down after my landlord tried to take down vines growing on the building by burning them.\n- Age 25: I left the army, started at Motorola Solutions as a mechanical engineer, and bought a house 20 minutes from the beach in Fort Lauderdale, FL.\n- Age 26: Began my Master's in Artificial Intelligence\n- Age 27: Began training Jiu Jitsu under Bruce Belfield at the Fort Lauderdale Jiu Jitsu.\n- Age 27: I got my scuba certification, [then the dive boat on my first dive sank](https://www.local10.com/news/local/2021/07/18/13-people-rescued-after-boat-begins-sinking-off-pompano-beach/). I was rescued by the boat behind the news anchor in that video. The propeller did not wrap up the anchor line. There were were high waves, it was a small boat and the captain tied to the shipwreck in the stern, so water started taking on.\n- Age 28: Graduated with my Master's, and began looking for PhDs\n- Age 28: Got married to my wife Maryam! \n- Age 29: Decided not to do a PhD, and move to Maryland to working at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab and do a Doctor of Engineering at JHU. A Doctor of Engineering is a professional doctoral program that is similar to a PhD, but is more focused on applied research instead of publications.\n\n\n# When I'm not working I like\n\n- Scuba diving\n- Running\n- Jiu Jitsu\n- Skiing\n- Florida weather\n- My hammock\n- Books, [these are my reviews for almost every book I've read](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/157985831-tony-davis?utf8=%E2%9C%93&shelf=read&title=tony-davis&per_page=100) \n- [Music](https://open.spotify.com/user/1217882921?si=0d478a355cf147b3)\n- Podcasts like [Freakonomics](https://freakonomics.com/), [Machine Learning Street Talk](https://open.spotify.com/show/02e6PZeIOdpmBGT9THuzwR) and info security show [Risky Business](https://risky.biz/)\n- Cerebral sci-fi movies like Vanilla Sky, Inception, Interstellar, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Prestige, Donnie Darko, and Mr. Nobody\n- Video games with good environment and narrative like Fallout New Vegas, Abe's Oddysee, Dark Souls, Half Life (especially in VR)\n- Team based shooters like Counter Strike and Halo\n\n# Travel / Geography\n\n- I grew up in Silver Spring, Maryland, just north of Washington DC.\n- I've been to Russia like 4 or 5 times in my childhood. I haven't been back since I was 12 because they didn't let me leave last time.\n- I lived in Columbus, Ohio for 5 years during my undergrad.\n- After college I moved to Columbus, Georgia for US Army training.\n- After training I was stationed in Bavaria, Germany. I lived an hour from Munich in a town called Regensburg. No, I didn't learn German, most people knew English.\n- While in Europe I traveled to the majority of countries in Europe. My favorites were Spain and Switzerland.\n- I've been to Canada and Mexico plenty of times, which is always fun.\n- I did a cruise around the Caribbean, does that count? \n- I've been to most big cities in the US, San Diego was my favorite.\n- I'm a fan of national parks.
