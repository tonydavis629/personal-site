Isn't that cool that AI is now a degree program? I'm really fascinated in the how the nature of knowledge is being probed by developing intelligent automated systems. My research involves investigating how AI can be used to enable automated aquaculture management systems. I hope my work can lead to technology that supports more harmonious relationships between man, technology and nature. \n\n# Current research interests\n\nI am working on a lot of different (read: too many) things at the moment. My main effort involves research at Dr. Bing Ouyang's lab at the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute, where we are developing the Hybrid Aerial Underwater Robotic System. The aim of this research is to reduce labor costs for aquaculture farms with intelligent networked robotics. We are also working on several underwater imaging and lidar projects. I also work for the Silicon Valley AI startup Deep Forest Sciences to implement bioinformatics tools in the open source machine learning library DeepChem. These tools are enabling biologists to use state of the art AI technology without needing to be AI experts. Besides all that, I continue to contribute to the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab building a realtime object tracking system for use on military vessels.\n\n# Some history\n\n- Age 3: I learned to swim, and I was on the swim team for like 10 years. \n- Age 6: I learned to tie my shoes after years of wearing velcro straps.  \n- Age 12: I picked up the guitar and got really obsessed with it. I played a guitar solo at my middle school band recital. I still have a passion for music, but nowadays I play the [Gotar](https://www.starrlabs.com/product/gotar-2/).\n- Age 13: I travel to Holland to represent the US in a swimming tournament. I got 6th place in the 200 m breaststroke which I thought was pretty good. I couldn't top that so I quit swimming.\n- Age 14: I started on the wrestling team in sophomore year of high school. I made it to regionals by my senior year.\n- Age 15: I started on the cross country team in junior year. I got shin splints really bad, but by the time I figured out how to run without injurying myself I really enjoyed it.\n- Age 15: I began my professional career as a Subway Sandwich Artist in Brightwood, DC. \n- Age 17: Planning for my career after high school, I walked into a Marine Corps recruiter's office. After looking at my grades, the recruiter recommends I go to college and join ROTC, so that's what I did. Thank you SSG Gonzalez! \n- Age 18: Enlisted in the Ohio National Guared, attended basic training in Fort Benning, Georgia and finished my freshman year of at Ohio State.\n- Age 21: I was elected the President of the OSU Scabbard and Blade chapter. We hosted talks and training by some really cool military specialists. \n- Age 22: I graduated with my Bacherlor's in Mechanical Engineering (after 10 semesters) and began my career as an Army infantry officer\n- Age 23: I moved to Germany where I was stationed\n- Age 25: [My 400 year old apartment in Regensburg, Germany](https://www.mittelbayerische.de/region/regensburg-stadt-nachrichten/flexarbeiten-setzten-haus-in-brand-21179-art1809502.html) burned down after my landlord tried to take down vines growing on the building by burning them.\n- Age 25: I left the army, started at Motorola Solutions as a mechanical engineer, and bought a house 20 minutes from the beach in Fort Lauderdale, FL.\n- Age 26: Began my Master's in Artificial Intelligence \n- Age 27: I got my scuba certification, [then the dive boat on my first dive sank](https://www.local10.com/news/local/2021/07/18/13-people-rescued-after-boat-begins-sinking-off-pompano-beach/). I was rescued by the boat behind the news anchor in that video. The propeller did not wrap up the anchor line. There were were high waves, it was a small boat and the captain tied to the shipwreck in the stern, so water started taking on.\n- Age 28: Graduated with my Master's, and began looking for PhDs\n\n\n# When I'm not working I like\n\n- Scuba diving\n- Running\n- Jiu Jitsu\n- Skiing\n- Florida weather\n- My hammock\n- Books, [these are my favorites](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/157985831-tony-davis?utf8=%E2%9C%93&shelf=read&title=tony-davis&per_page=100) \n- [Music](https://open.spotify.com/user/1217882921?si=0d478a355cf147b3)\n- Podcasts like [Freakonomics](https://freakonomics.com/), [Machine Learning Street Talk](https://open.spotify.com/show/02e6PZeIOdpmBGT9THuzwR) and cybersecurity show [Risky Business](https://risky.biz/)\n- Cerebral sci-fi movies like Vanilla Sky, Inception, Interstellar, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Prestige, Donnie Darko, and Mr. Nobody\n- Video games with good environment and narrative like Fallout New Vegas, Abe's Oddysee, Dark Souls, Half Life (especially in VR)\n- Team based shooters like Counter Strike and Halo\n\n# Travel / Geography\n\n- I grew up in Silver Spring, Maryland, just north of Washington DC.\n- I've been to Russia like 4 or 5 times in my childhood. I haven't been back since I was 12 because they didn't let me leave last time.\n- I lived in Columbus, Ohio for 5 years during my undergrad\n- After college I moved to Columbus, Georgia for US Army training\n- After training I was stationed in Bavaria, Germany.
